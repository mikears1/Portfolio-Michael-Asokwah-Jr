# General
Various labs and projects that I have worked on in Python. 

1. (L8q1.py) This program simulates an employee database, with the user able to
 add, look up, edit, or delete employees form the database. 
2. (L9q1.py)  This program simulates a bagel store with a graphical interface, the user is able to select a bagel and add one or multiple desired toppings,
displaying the price at the end of the order.
3. (number_guesser.py) This program simulates a number guessing game, first asking the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. Once the correct number is guessed, the user is asked if they would like to continue playing. If so, the range increases by a factor of 10 (eg. 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, etc.)
